# Computational-Modeling---Talent-vs.-Luck

This university project aims to replicate and critically evaluate the findings of the paper "Talent versus Luck: The Role of Randomness in Success and Failure" by Alessandro Pluchino, Alessio Emanuele Biondo, and Andrea Rapisarda. The original paper explores the impact of talent and luck on individual success, using an agent-based simulation model. Our replication involves implementing the simulation, running various scenarios, and analyzing the results.
